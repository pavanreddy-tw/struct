Start ingesting and analyzing your data now! The Incorta Direct Data Platform™ is a unified data and analytics platform.
Intended for an Incorta user that belongs to a group assigned the Super User role or a Super User for the tenant, this Start guide will walk you through each step to access and analyze your data, from signing in to creating and sharing dashboards.
Sign in to the Incorta Analytics Service
The first step to access your data is to sign in to the Incorta Analytics Service. The Analytics Service is a web user interface for administrators, developers, business users, and analysts. Typically, the division of labor breaks out as follows:
1.	Super Users and schema developers create data sources.
2.	Schema developers create physical schemas and logical business schemas.
3.	Dashboard developers and power business analysts design, develop, and share dashboards.
4.	Business users and data analysts are dashboard consumers.
Your Turn
To access the Incorta Analytics Service, log in to Incorta Cloud using either a Chrome or Firefox web browser, and then connect to your cluster. When the cluster is connected, select the Incorta button to open your instance in a new tab.
When signing in to the Analytics Services, a user specifies a tenant. A tenant represents an organizational unit and contains:
1.	Users
2.	Groups
3.	Data Sources and Files
4.	Schemas, Business Schemas, and Session Variables
5.	Alerts and Schedules
6.	Dashboards
Your Turn
Sign in to Incorta.
1.	In the sign in page, specify your Tenant, Username, and Password.
2.	Select Sign In.
3.	Or, Select the Use Single Sign-on button.
4.	Specify your Tenant, and then select Continue.
